In [Dagan (2021)](papers/Dagan.pdf), the effect size of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine was reported. It was stated in the `results` that 

> Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95) ...

Now, let's replicate this result. The definition of the __effect size of a vaccine is defined as 1 - RR__. Hence, let's focus on calculating the RR. To obtain the data, the `Statistical Analysis` section states: 

> We considered three periods: days 14 through 20 after the first dose of vaccine, days 21 through 27 after the first dose (administration of the second dose was scheduled to occur on day 21 after the first dose), and day 7 after the second dose until the end of the follow-up.

Figure 2A presents all the data we need to make this calculation.

At 7 days after the second dose, i.e., day 28, the sample size of the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups are  107,209 and 108,529. The number of infections (starting from this date till the end of the study) are 6100 - 5775 = 325 and 4460 - 4406 = 54 respectively. 

```{r}
  # we need to specify the data of the first column, then second column
  freqtable = matrix(c(116657, 41856, 161, 8),nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
  
  # this is for naming the items properly (not a necessary step)
  # the R function will automatically assign them some name if you leave them empty. 
  rownames(freqtable) = c("Unvaccinated", "Partially immunized")
  colnames(freqtable) = c("Not Infected", "Infected")  

  riskratio(freqtable)
```
