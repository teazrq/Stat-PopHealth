## When is Relative Risk not appropriate? 

Relative Risk is only appropriate for prospective studies in which we have a clear definition of the two study groups and observe their outcome over a certain period of time. Having all these data is necessary to calculate the probability of the event in each group. However, when we have a case-control study, this is not valid anymore. 

  * In a (retrospective) __case control study__ for detecting cancer-associated genetic markers, we may collect the following data. Note that in this case, the total number in each column is pre-defined by the researcher. 
  
$\quad$       | Have Cancer | No Cancer | Total
-----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
Genotype AA | 690 | 436 | 1126
Genotype Aa/aa | 310  | 564 | 874
Total | 1000 | 1000 | 2000
