## Weekly Objectives

  * Learn and be able to calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, quantile, contingency table and correlation
  * Use R to perform one-sample and two-sample tests, such as z-test and t-test
  * Be able to read contingency tables and use statistical tests (fisherâ€™s exact test and chi-square test) for associations
  * Interpret p-values in various statistical tests

## Lecture Note and R Examples

  + [[Introduction to R, RStudio and R Markdown](notes/week2/R-Intro.html){target='_blank'}]
  + The original `.Rmd` [`r xfun::embed_file('docs/notes/week2/R-Intro.Rmd', text = 'Source File')`] used to generate the lecture note
  + The [birthrate data](data/birthrate.csv){target='_blank'} in `.csv` format
  
## R Examples

  + R Markdown [[Tutorial](https://teazrq.github.io/SMLR/rmarkdown-basics.html)], its [[Source File](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/teazrq/SMLR/blob/master/1.2-rmd-basics.Rmd)]
  + The [skin cancer data](data/skincancer.txt){target='_blank'}
  
## NHANCE data introduction

You need to use some public available dataset to support the final project analysis. [NHANCE data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/){target='_blank'} is a rich nation-wide questionnaire data provided by the CDC. If you choose to use the NHANCE data, some data processing need to be done. Here is a [[toy example](rcode/week2/ReadNHANCEData.html)] for downloading and processing the [2015-2016 data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015). For your own analysis, you may want to consider the more recent [2017-2018 data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2017){target='_blank'}. Additional source and data files:

  * [Toy example](rcode/week2/ReadNHANCEData.html){target='_blank'}
  * `.Rmd` [`r xfun::embed_file('docs/rcode/week2/ReadNHANCEData.Rmd', text = 'Source File')`]
  * Data Files (from NHANES 2015-2016)
      + Demographic data: [DEMO_I.XPT](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.XPT)
      + Diabetes data: [DIQ_I.XPT](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DIQ_I.XPT)
      + Examination data: [BMX_I.XPT](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BMX_I.XPT)

## Homework

  + Discuss with your team members about the final project idea and data sources
  + Practice the summary statistics and data visualization functions in R
  + Reading: Sections 5.5.4 from the [BPS textbook](info.html) to prepare for next week's lecture
